# REST-API-app-practice
This project is a REST API built using Flask and Docker that provides a set of endpoints for sorting arrays, performing binary search, checking if an array is sorted, and running search algorithms on graphs (DFS and BFS). The API allows users to send requests with JSON payloads to the server and receive computed results such as sorted arrays, search results, and traversal paths.

The project is structured using Docker for ease of deployment and environment consistency, allowing developers to run the app in a containerized environment without needing to worry about dependencies.
There are some issues i am trying to solve at the moment
